# Seed_Nanopriming

This is online interactive web app for interpretable machine learning-aided seed nanopriming research🌱

### Background 👨🏼‍🌾
    - Agriculture is facing the challenges of climate change, soil degradation, environmental pollution, and limited resources.
    - Existing food growth trends are insufficient to feed the population in 2050. 
    - Seed nanopriming is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution for food sustainability.
    - There is a knowledge gap regarding the nanoparticle uptake and the underlying physiological mechanism due to the diversity of nanomaterials and the complexity of nano-plant/seed-environment interactions. 
    - interpretable machine learning holds great potential to understand the complex problems.
